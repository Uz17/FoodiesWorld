                <p>Tangy, creamy, and with a hint of spice, you can't beat pimento cheese when it comes to classic
                    Southern side dishes. Serve it with crackers for dipping, or smear on toast points for a fancier
                    presentation. </p>

                <h2>Recipe 2</h2>
                <p>No fish are required for this beloved Texan dish. Black and pinto beans, along with corn, make up the
                    base. Each bite is seasoned with peppers, cilantro, and a zippy sweet and sour dressing. This makes
                    a great picnic dish in the South because there's no mayo to keep cool.

                <p>Irresistibly crunchy, deep-fried peanuts are the salty side dish that you didn't know you needed.
                    "Passed down through generations, this is sure crowd pleaser," says Kristi Whittington.
